<wokwi-led color="green" label="12"></wokwi-led>

Click <strong>Run Code</strong> to compile and run the code, and you will see
the red LED blinking in different rates, according to the 6 tasks defined
in the demo code.

Can you change the code so that the green LED (connected to pin 12) blinks two
times per second, while the red LED keeps blinking at different rates?
